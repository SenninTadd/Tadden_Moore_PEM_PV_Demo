# Minimal Test Requirements for MC Framework
# Author: Tadden Moore
# Date: 2025-11-16
#
# These dependencies allow running the test suite without downloading
# large models or requiring GPU hardware.

# Core testing framework
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0
pytest-mock>=3.10.0

# Minimal ML dependencies (CPU only)
torch>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Note: We do NOT include transformers, sae-lens, or accelerate here
# because the test suite uses mocks and doesn't require actual models.
# This keeps CI/CD fast and lightweight.

# For full integration testing with real models, use requirements.txt instead
